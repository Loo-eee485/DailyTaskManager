This is my first solo project and intention behind this is, to build a project with the foundational knowledge that I do have and put into practice solving problems alone.

The goal is the build a daily task manager that works.
The user will be able to fill out a task title, description, and due date. The tasks will be presented in card format. The tasks can be added, marked as completed, and deleted at the user's will.
